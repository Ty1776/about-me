  <main>
    <p>Hello! My name is Tyler. I am an adventurer (particularly overlanding), si-fi fan, gamer, and enjoy building/creating. I do not have any pets. While in high school, I attended the Running Start program and graduated high school with 2 Associates Degrees. After high school, I worked for a couple of years before joining the Air Force and serving for 6 years. Towards the end of my Air Force contract I was able to begin work as an HVAC technician, and that is what I have done until taking this course. A dream of mine is to work in game development and someday be a spokesperson, traveling to conventions to hype the new games!</p>
